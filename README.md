# WorkDay-Schedule

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a workday calender that helps a user enter events for a 9-5 hour day and save the tasks each hour
- This webpage includes a time block of 9Am-5Pm divided into hour intervals, and gets the current time from dayjs, which then shows the time that has passed, the present hour, and future hours
- From this project, I learned how to link dayjs into my javascript file to get the current time and work with my html displays based ont he time
